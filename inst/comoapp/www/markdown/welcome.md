### Welcome to the CoMo Consortium App!

The COVID-19 International Modelling Consortium (CoMo Consortium) was created by researchers at the University of Oxford together with academic colleagues at Cornell University and is partnering with infectious disease modellers and other public health experts from more than 40 countries across Africa, Asia, and South and North America.

The CoMo Consortium has developed an age-structured, compartmental SEIRS (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible) model to estimate the trajectory of COVID-19 based on different scenarios, and assess the potential impact of the various behavioural change strategies as well as treatment and vaccines, when they become available. **This App aims to provide an interface to this model.**
