## Important Disclaimer

Whilst every effort has been taken during the development of this tool/model for it to be as accurate and reliable as possible it is important that the user understands that the outputs are a prediction based on the assumptions chosen through the input parameter values. In view of the current uncertainty on the COVID-19 mechanisms of action, the output of the model should be used to explore multiple scenarios and in combination with a larger evidence base during decision-making.

The appropriate use of this tool/model and its output can contribute to effective policymaking, but misuse or misinterpretation of the output can mislead decision-making. Any decisions taken whist using these tools are the responsibility of the user and no liability whatsoever will be taken by the developers/authors of the tool.

## Installation

The [App is online](https://comomodel.net) but can also be run locally. Follow the instructions below to install, update or launch the offline App.

### Install Offline App

- [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org) (any version above 3.6.1)
- Open R and run in the console: `install.packages("remotes")`
- Run: `remotes::install_github("ocelhay/como", upgrade = "never")`
- Close and reopen R.


To launch the CoMo App, open R and run in the console: `como::comomodel()`.

To update to the latest version, run: `remotes::install_github("ocelhay/como", upgrade = "never")`


### Troubleshooting

1. During the installation, if prompted `--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---`, select 'Cloud'.
2. During the installation, if prompted `Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)`, return `no`.
3. If the internet connection is not steady, re-run the commands as often as required for the download to proceed.
4. Restart R and update all packages `update.packages()`
