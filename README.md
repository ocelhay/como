# CoMo COVID-19 App

## Important Disclaimer

Whilst every effort has been taken during the development of this tool/model for it to be as accurate and reliable as possible it is important that the user understands that the outputs are a prediction based on the assumptions chosen through the input parameter values. In view of the current uncertainty on the COVID-19 mechanisms of action, the output of the model should be used to explore multiple scenarios and in combination with a larger evidence base during decision-making.

The appropriate use of this tool/model and its output can contribute to effective policymaking, but misuse or misinterpretation of the output can mislead decision-making. Any decisions taken whist using these tools are the responsibility of the user and no liability whatsoever will be taken by the developers/authors of the tool.


## About

The interface was developed after consultation with several members of the CoMo Consortium. It possesses all the features and functionalities necessary to successfully perform a model fit to the available data and investigate the potential impact of several non-pharmaceutical interventions.

The [App is online](https://comomodel.net) but can also be run locally. Follow the instructions below to install, update or launch the offline App.

pacman::p_load(bsplus, DT, deSolve, highcharter, lubridate, pushbar, RColorBrewer, readxl, remotes,
               reshape2, scales, shiny, shinyBS, shinycssloaders, shinyhelper, shinythemes,
