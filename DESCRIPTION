Description: The Covid-19 International Modelling Consortium (CoMo Consortium) 
    is made up of various working groups. Each working group plays a specific role in 
    formulating a mathematical modelling response to help guide policymaking responses
    to the Covid-19 pandemic. This Web Application offers an access to a mathematical model 
    that allows to investigate the potential impact of several non-pharmaceutical interventions.
